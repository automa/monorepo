### Legal Boilerplate[^1]

Look, I get it. The entity doing business as "Automa" was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2016 as Sunkara, Inc. and is gonna need some rights from me in order to utilize my contributions in this here PR. So here's the deal: I retain all rights, title and interest in and to my contributions, and by keeping this boilerplate intact I confirm that Automa can use, modify, copy, and redistribute my contributions, under Automa's choice of terms.
