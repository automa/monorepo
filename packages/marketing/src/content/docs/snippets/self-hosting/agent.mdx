It contains the following components:

- **Cache**: A key-value store for jobs & caching.
- **Agent**: The agent that responds to Automa and implements tasks.

## Automa bot

You would need to [register a bot](/bot-development/registration) of [manual](/bots/types#manual) type in Automa (Cloud or Self-hosted) and configure it's webhook URL to point to the **Agent** service. The webhook URL will be `http://<your-server>/hooks/automa` if you are running it on a server with either a public IP address or domain name. Make sure to copy the **Webhook Secret** from Automa.

<Note>
  If you are running the agent on your local machine, you'll need to expose your
  local **Agent** service to the public internet so that Automa's webhooks can
  reach it. A tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) can create a secure tunnel
  to your `localhost`. You would then set the public URL provided by the tool as
  the webhook URL for the agent in Automa.
