#### Check the setup

If you have successfully deployed the template, you should see 2 healthy services in your Railway project: **Agent** and **Redis**.

The **Agent** service in the Railway project should have been automatically assigned a domain name by Railway in the form of `<random>.up.railway.app`. You can find this by clicking on the service. Make sure to update the webhook URL of the agent in Automa to match this domain.

### Updating

We recommend updating periodically to ensure you have the latest features and security updates. To update your **Agent** service, go to the service in your Railway project, click on the "**Deployments**" tab, click on **three dots** on active deployment, and then choose the "**Redeploy**" option. This will pull the latest changes and redeploy your service.
