You can register a new bot in Automa by going to [Settings > Bots > Create Bot](https://console.automa.app/$/settings/bots/new).

    Provide a unique name for your bot within your organization and a short
    description to help users understand its purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a trigger type">
    Choose between [manual](/bots/types#manual) and
    [scheduled](/bots/types#scheduled) bot types. Manual bots run on demand,
    while scheduled bots run at specified intervals.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the webhook URL">
    Provide the URL where Automa will send webhook events.

  <Step title="Save the webhook secret">
    After creation, copy the webhook secret. Your bot will use this secret to
    verify that incoming events are from Automa.
