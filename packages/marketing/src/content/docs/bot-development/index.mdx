<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your bot">
    Register your bot with Automa by providing a name, description, and webhook
    URL. This step connects your bot to Automa, making it available for users to
    install.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Develop functionality">
    Implement the core logic of your bot to handle webhook events. This involves
    receiving tasks from Automa, processing them, and sending back the results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test locally">
    Thoroughly test your bot locally to ensure it functions correctly. For
    integration testing, expose your local development server to the internet
    using a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). This allows
    Automa to send webhook events to your bot for real-time testing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    Deploy your bot to a cloud platform and update its webhook URL in Automa if
    needed.
