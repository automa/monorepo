```json filename="automa.json"
{
  "bots": {
    "dependency": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "ecosystems": ["npm"],
          "limit": 5
        },
        {
          "ecosystems": ["cargo"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

At max 5 open NPM PRs. At max 10 total open dependency PRs.

- When a NPM PR is about to be made, it will be created only if open NPM PRs are less than 5 and total open PRs are less than 10.
- When a cargo PR is about to be made, it will be created only if total open PRs are less than 10.

```json filename="automa.json"
{
  "bots": {
    "dependency": {
      "limit": 10,
      "groups": [
        {
          "ecosystems": ["npm"],
          "limit": 5
        },
        {
          "ecosystems": ["cargo"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

10 max open NPM PRs setting overrides the 5 max total open dependency PRs.

- When a NPM PR is about to be made, it will be created only if open NPM PRs are less than 10 and disregards the total open PRs count.
- When a cargo PR is about to be made, it will be created only if total open PRs are less than 5.

```json filename="automa.json"
{
  "bots": {
    "dependency": {
      "limit": 5,
      "groups": [
        {
          "ecosystems": ["npm"],
          "limit": 10
        },
        {
          "ecosystems": ["cargo"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
