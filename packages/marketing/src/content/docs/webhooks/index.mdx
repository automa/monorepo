---

In Automa, webhooks are used to notify your bot about various events, such as task creation, proposal updates, and more. This allows your bot to respond to changes in real-time.

Automa's webhooks follow the [Standard Webhooks](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) specification, which means they are designed to be secure and reliable. Therefore, all the events use the following payload structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the webhook event.
- `type`: The type of event (e.g., `task.created`, `proposal.accepted`).
- `timestamp`: The time when the event occurred, in ISO 8601 format.
- `data`: The event-specific data, which varies based on the event type.

```json
{
  "id": "whmsg_task_created_1234",
  "type": "task.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-28T04:58:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    /* task, repo, org, items */
  }
}
```

The events are also accompanied by the following headers:

- `webhook-id`: the same as payload `id`
- `webhook-timestamp`: UNIX timestamp of when the event occurred (seconds since epoch)
- `webhook-signature`: the signature(s) of the webhook used to verify the payload
- `x-automa-server-host`: the URL of the Automa server that sent the webhook

### Verifying signatures

To ensure the integrity and origin of webhooks, Automa signs each one using HMAC-SHA256. The signature is passed in the `webhook-signature` header, which includes a version identifier and the signature in base64 format, separated by a comma (e.g., `v1,d82n...`).

The signature is generated using your bot's webhook secret (excluding the `atma_whsec_` prefix). The content that is signed is a string made by concatenating the webhook ID, the timestamp in unix format, and the raw request body, joined by periods.

```
{id}.{timestamp}.{body}
```

We strongly recommend using our [Bot SDKs](/sdks/bot), which provide a helper function to verify the signature for you.

## Retries

When a webhook event is sent, Automa ensures that it is delivered successfully. If a delivery fails due to a non-2xx response or a network issue, Automa will retry.

The retry policy uses an **exponential backoff** strategy, with an initial delay of **10 minutes** and a maximum of **5 attempts**. The delay doubles with each subsequent retry.

To prevent side effects from repeated deliveries:

- Use the webhook id to detect and discard duplicate requests.
- Ensure your webhook handler is idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
- Use locking to protect shared resources from race conditions.
