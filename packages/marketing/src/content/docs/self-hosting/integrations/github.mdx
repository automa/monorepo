description: A step-by-step guide to configure GitHub integration for Automa
---

Automa supports [GitHub](https://github.com) integration for:

- **Source Code Management:** Allows users to let the bots read the code. And allows bots to create pull requests to propose code changes after working on a task.

## Creating app

Assuming you have already [set up Automa](/self-hosting#automa), when you open **Automa Console** for the first time, if Automa doesn't detect a GitHub integration configuration, it will prompt you to create a [Github App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/about-using-github-apps). And once you complete it, we retrieve the necessary secrets which would need to be set as environment variables.

<Tip>
  It only prompts you if you have not configured any **source code management**
  integration. If you haven't been prompted and still want to create a GitHub
  app and configure it, you can do so by visiting `/admin/setup/code`.
</Tip>

## Adding environment variables

To configure the GitHub integration, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`: The slug of your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_APP_PEM`: The PEM file of your GitHub App, which contains the private key.
- `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: The webhook secret for the webhook in your GitHub App.
