Claude Code agent for Automa is based on [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://anthropic.com/claude-code) CLI tool. It's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/automa/claude-code).

<SelfHostingAgent title="Claude Code" />

- **Docker**: to run the cache, and Claude Code agent container.
- **Docker network**: containers must share a user-defined network (e.g. `automa-claude-code`).
- **Anthropic API Key**: to use Anthropic's models.

#### Cache

We use [Redis](https://redis.io/) for the key-value store. The Redis container will store its data in a Docker volume named `automa-claude-code-redis-data`. It listens on port 6379. Make sure to replace `<cache-password>` with a secure password of your choice.

```bash icon="terminal"
docker run -d --name automa-claude-code-redis \
  --network automa-claude-code \
  -e REDIS_PASSWORD=<cache-password> \
  -v automa-claude-code-redis-data:/data \
  -p 6379:6379 \
  redis:7-alpine
```

<Tip>
  If you are self-hosting Automa, you can use the **Cache** service from it
  instead of setting up a separate cache. Just make sure the Claude Code agent
  is on the same network as your Automa services.
</Tip>

#### Agent

We use the latest [Automa Claude Code agent image](https://ghcr.io/automa/claude-code). The Agent will connect to the Redis container. It listens on port 8000. Make sure to replace `<anthropic-api-key>` with your Anthropic API key, `<webhook-secret>` with the webhook secret you copied from Automa earlier and `<cache-password>` with the password you set earlier.

```bash icon="terminal"
docker run -d --name automa-claude-code \
  --network automa-claude-code \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<anthropic-api-key> \
  -e AUTOMA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook-secret> \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://:<cache-password>@localhost:6379 \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  ghcr.io/automa/claude-code
```

#### Check the setup

You can check if the containers are running with the following command:

```bash icon="terminal"
docker ps
```

### Updating

We recommend updating periodically to ensure you have the latest features and security updates. To update your services:

```bash icon="terminal"
docker pull ghcr.io/automa/claude-code
docker restart automa-claude-code
```

## Railway

Automa publishes official [Railway](https://railway.com) templates for the Claude Code agent. This section will help you set it up using Railway.

### Setting up

There are 2 steps in the setup process:

- Start the needed services.
- Check if the services are working.

#### Start services

You will need an account on [Railway](https://railway.com) to get started. Once you have an account, go to the [Automa Claude Code agent template](https://railway.com/deploy/UQSi48?referralCode=Ri3kTG) and deploy it by clicking on the "**Deploy Now**" button.

You would need to provide the following environment variables for the **Agent** service:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key.
- `AUTOMA_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: The webhook secret you copied from Automa earlier.
