Automa publishes official [Railway](https://railway.com) templates for the whole application. This section will help you set it up using Railway.

## Setting up

There are 3 steps in the setup process:

- Start the needed services.
- Check if the services are working.
- Configure third-party integrations.

### Start services

You will need an account on [Railway](https://railway.com) to get started. Once you have an account, go to the [Automa template](https://railway.com/deploy/PKfjlB?referralCode=Ri3kTG) and deploy it by clicking on the "**Deploy Now**" button.

### Check the setup

If you have successfully deployed the template, you should see 4 healthy services in your Railway project: **API**, **Console**, **Postgres**, and **Redis**.

The **Console** service in the Railway project should have been automatically assigned a domain name by Railway in the form of `<random>.up.railway.app`. You can find this by clicking on the service, and if you visit this domain in your browser, you should see the **Automa Console** interface.

### Configuring integrations

#### Adding environment variables

When you are configuring third-party integrations, you will need to add environment variables to the **API** service in the Railway project.

For example, to add a Jira integration, go to the **API** service in your Railway project, click on the "**Variables**" tab, and add the new environment variables.

## Updating

We recommend updating periodically to ensure you have the latest features and security updates. To update your **API** and **Console** services, go to each service in your Railway project, click on the "**Deployments**" tab, click on **three dots** on active deployment, and then choose the "**Redeploy**" option. This will pull the latest changes and redeploy your service.
