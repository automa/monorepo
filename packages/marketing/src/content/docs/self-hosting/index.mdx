## Automa

Automa is a source-available platform for code automation that you can run on your own servers. Its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/automa/monorepo).

It contains the following components:

- **Database**: A database for storing data.
- **Cache**: A key-value store for jobs, caching, and session management.
- **API**: The backend server that handles requests and integrates with external tools.
- **Console**: The web UI for interacting with the API to manage agents, tasks, and settings.

You can set up Automa in various ways, depending on your infrastructure and preferences. Below are the recommended methods:

## Agents

Automa also provides open-source agents that you can run on your own servers. Their source code is available in our GitHub [organization](https://github.com/automa).

Below are some of the agents that you can self-host:
