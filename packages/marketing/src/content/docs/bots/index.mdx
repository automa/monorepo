A bot in Automa is a remote coding assistant designed to handle various coding tasks. Think of it as a specialized tool in your development workflow, running in the cloud and always available. Bots connect to Automa as external services via webhooks, meaning anyone can build and integrate their own custom bots.

## Bot vs Agent

While all agents are a type of bot, not all bots are agents. Here's the key difference:

- **Bots** are designed to follow a specific, predefined set of rules to perform a task.
- **Agents** possess a greater degree of autonomy. They can analyze code, understand context, and make decisions on how to best approach a task. This makes agents ideal for complex scenarios that require a deeper understanding of your codebase.

## Use cases

Bots can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

- _Writing boilerplate code_ for new features or components.
- _Fixing minor bugs_ that follow predictable patterns.
- _Updating dependencies_ to the latest versions.
- _Changing page copy_ to improve user experience.
- _Configuring tools_ across multiple projects.
- _Renaming variables_ to improve code readability.
- _Improving accessibility_ to meet standards.
- _Adding observability_ to monitor performance.
- _Tracking analytics_ to understand user behavior.
- _Localizing content_ for different languages.
- _Covering edge cases_ by extending existing tests.
- _Migrating code_ to new APIs or frameworks.
