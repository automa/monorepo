Bots in Automa are categorized along two dimensions: how they are triggered and how they execute tasks. Understanding these helps you choose or build the right bot for your needs.

## Trigger

This dimension defines how a task is initiated and assigned to a bot.

### Manual

Manual bots are triggered by direct user action, either through the Automa UI or via integrations. They are perfect for on-demand tasks where you need full control over when the bot runs.

### Scheduled

Scheduled bots operate on a fixed, recurring schedule. Automa automatically creates and assigns tasks to them at set intervals, making them ideal for routine maintenance and other recurring automations.

<Warning>
  Right now, scheduled bots run once a week on Monday at 00:00 UTC. We're
  working to add more scheduling options soon!

## Logic

This dimension defines how a bot processes tasks and makes decisions.

### Deterministic

Deterministic bots operate based on a predefined set of rules. They deliver consistent, predictable outcomes, making them ideal for repeatable tasks like scaffolding, code generation, or simple refactoring.

### AI

AI bots use machine learning models (like LLMs) to analyze context and generate solutions dynamically. They excel at open-ended tasks like implementing features, writing unit tests, or drafting documentation.
