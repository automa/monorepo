As developers, we should be free to focus on what matters: building
great software. But we're often bogged down by mundane tasks that,
while necessary, don't always spark joy or push our skills to new heights.
The good news is, a lot of this **grunt work** can be automated!

But how do we do that safely and correctly, without causing unexpected issues?

At **Automa**, we believe the key to effective automation lies in a deep
understanding of the codebase. We also believe that current transformer-based
**LLMs**, being just pattern-matching machines, are not on a path to **AGI**.

Code automation isn't about asking a general-purpose LLM to perform
tasks it doesn't truly comprehend. It requires a deep, structural
understanding of your code: knowing precisely what it does, how it's
structured, and the ripple effects of every change.

Since LLMs are not on a path to AGI, a different approach is needed to
improve their performance on code. This is where our **Code Understanding**
technology comes into play, allowing us to layer specialized, human-like
knowledge on top of LLMs.

We'd love for you to join us on our journey to _automate the mundane
and elevate the meaningful_.
